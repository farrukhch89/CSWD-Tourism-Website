						<h3>Chamarel</h3>
						<img src = "images/chamarel.jpg" alt= "chamarel">
						<p>The seven colored earth is a natural phenomenon and a prominent tourist attraction. The colors evolved through conversion of basaltic lava to clay minerals.</p>

						<p>It is a relatively small area ofsand dunes comprising sand of seven distinct colours (approximately red, brown, violet, green, blue, purple and yellow).Due to the tropical weather conditions, all water-soluble elements such as silicon dioxide have been washed out. The remains are the reddish-black iron- and aluminium oxides which create shades in blue, cyan and purple. The various colors developed due to the different compositions. And what is more fascinating is the fact that if you mix the colored earth together, they'll eventually settle into separate layers</p>

						<h3>Pond Naturel</h3>
						<img src = "images/pont-naturel.jpg" alt= "pont">
						<p> Pont Naturel (Natural Bridge) is exactly what the name says. It's a volcanic rock formation (2 meters or 6.5 feet long) that looks like a man-made bridge yet it is formed by natural processes. It's a part of the cliff at Gris-Gris. If you are brave enough, you can try to cross it, you will see the waves hitting the rocks underneath and sometimes passing over the bridge. This spot is another amazing point for great photographs, you just need to be patient while waiting for the waves to come. On the surface, there are many little holes through which sea water goes making whistling sounds. That's why this place is also called "le soufler" which means "a blower". </p>
